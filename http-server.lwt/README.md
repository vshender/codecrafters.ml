## Introduction

Welcome to the Build your own HTTP server challenge!

HTTP is the protocol that powers the web.  In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP server that's capable of handling simple GET/POST requests, serving files and handling multiple concurrent connections.

Along the way, we'll learn about TCP connections, HTTP headers, HTTP verbs, handling multiple connections and more.
